The whole process of handing off was terrible, and people would spend a lot of time just trying to find out who was in charge of what.

**Building the Solution:** I didn't even hesitate to scrap the whole workflow and start over from zero. The main challenge was getting people to stop using a system they've been accustomed to for years:

• **Tech Stack Choices:** Used Next.js for the frontend (something new yet still in the team's comfort zone) and Express + PostgreSQL for the backend to handle complex queries with ease

• **Authentication & RBAC:** Integrated JWT with a modular RBAC system supporting 6 different business roles with their own permission levels. Made it configurable so adding new roles wouldn't require code changes

• **AI-Powered Automation:** Built an n8n AI workflow that automatically summarizes business cases, reducing managers' review time by 40%. They no longer had to spend hours reading through hundreds of cases

• **Enterprise Features:** Implemented OAuth for SSO, SMTP notifications (optimized to p95 latency of 8s), optimistic concurrency control to avoid data conflicts, and ACID-compliant audit logging

**The Impact:** Intake time was cut by 35%, manual hand-offs were eliminated, and the staff were delighted with the system. It's an amazing feeling to witness the people who really use the product getting the benefits of what I built.`,contract:a.Internship,type:"Software Engineering",location:"Beijing, China",period:{from:new Date(2025,5,30),to:new Date(2025,8,7)},skills:t("nextjs","nodejs","expressjs","postgresql","ts","jwt","oauth"),name:"Software Engineering Intern",color:"blue",links:[],logo:e.Apple,shortDescription:"My first enterprise experience!

Joining an agile team of 80 people was completely different from working solo—now I had to review pull requests, coordinate with designers and managers, and ship MVPs every semester.

• **Mentorship & Documentation:** Wrote guides for new members to help them get up to speed quickly. Writing clear documentation became one of my first priorities in the large team setting

• **LLM Prompt Engineering:** Developed prompts for an LLM program that extracts deadlines from course syllabi. Achieving 97% accuracy required extensive prompt engineering and handling dozens of edge cases—professors format syllabi in wildly different ways, so making the system robust was essential

• **Real-Time Data Sync:** Integrated Supabase real-time to solve a tricky problem: how to avoid stale data when multiple users access the same information simultaneously? Real-time updates meant all users always saw the latest changes, greatly reducing conflicts

• **Multi-Provider Authentication:** Implemented an OAuth-based authentication system for both Firebase and Supabase. The interesting challenge was managing multiple auth providers while keeping the UI consistent

**Key Takeaway:** It's one thing to implement features, it's another to build them in a way that colleagues can understand and maintain. Working in such a large team taught me to write clearer code, communicate technical decisions better, and appreciate the value of good documentation.`,contract:a.PartTime,type:"Software Development",location:"Ithaca, NY",period:{from:new Date(2024,8,1)},skills:t("ts","reactjs","firebase","supabase","oauth"),name:"Full-Stack Software Development Engineer",color:"red",links:[],logo:e.CornellDTI,shortDescription:"Growing as a team player in a large agile environment while mentoring newcomers and shipping real products"},{slug:"cornell-ta",company:"Cornell Bowers CIS",description:"Mentorship is what I value the most.",contract:a.PartTime,type:"Teaching",location:"Ithaca, NY",period:{from:new Date(2024,7,1)},skills:t("python","ocaml"),name:"Teaching Assistant",color:"green",links:[],logo:e.Cornell,shortDescription:"Giving back by helping others succeed—mentoring students taught me as much as I taught them"},{slug:"ezmodel",color:"#00D9FF",description:'Ezmodel is just "figma" for designing database schema.',shortDescription:"Leading my first engineering team!
